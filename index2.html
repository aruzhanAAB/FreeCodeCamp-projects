<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Egg white
200 g</li>
<li>Citric acid 2 g</li>
<li>Powdered sugar 330 g</li>
<li>Starch 20 g</li>
<li>Almond petals 25 g</li>
<li>Cottage cheese 150 g</li>
<li>Cream 33% ml</li>
<li>Pistachio paste 25g
</li>
<li>Raspberry puree
100g</li>
<li>Fresh raspberries 30 g</li>
<li>Fresh mint 1 sprig</li>
</ul>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Separate the egg whites from the yolks. Measure out exactly 200g. Add 300g of powdered sugar and citric acid. Whip the meringue: first at low speed until light foam forms, then at high speed until stiff peaks form.
Using a spatula, fold 40g of starch into the finished meringue.</li>
<li>Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat. Spread a thin, even layer of the meringue on the mat.
Sprinkle with flaked almonds and bake the meringue in a preheated oven at 160 degrees Celsius (325 degrees Fahrenheit) for 35 minutes.</li>
<li>In a saucepan, combine the raspberry puree and cornstarch and mix thoroughly. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it comes to a gentle simmer, stirring constantly.
Remove the raspberry filling from the heat and pour it into a bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until completely cool, then transfer to a pastry bag.</li>
<li>For the filling, combine the cream cheese, powdered sugar, pistachio paste, and heavy cream in a bowl. Beat with a mixer until smooth and thick. Transfer the cream to a pastry bag fitted with a closed star tip and refrigerate. </li>
<li>Remove the finished meringue from the oven and let it cool. Cover it with a second baking sheet lined with a silicone mat. Turn the baking sheet over so the silicone mat is facing up. Carefully remove the mat from the meringue.</li>
<li>Spread the pistachio cream (reserve some for decoration) and raspberry filling over the meringue. Roll it into a roulade.</li>
<li>Trim the edges of the meringue and transfer the roll to a serving plate.
Garnish with the remaining pistachio cream, fresh raspberries, and mint.
Serve.</li>
